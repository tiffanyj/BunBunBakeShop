      <h1>Welcome to Bun Bun Bake Shop!</h1>
      <h2>—  Serving baked goods to Pittsburgh since 2003 —</h2>
      <p>Our bakery has been happily serving up sweets to the people of Pittsburgh for over a decade. We are a small bakery that specializes in cinnamon rolls. Our rolls come in a wide range of artisan flavors from Pumpkin Spice to Maple Apple Bacon. If you're looking for a classic cinnamon roll, we're famous for that too. While our shop is located in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh, we ship fresh rolls to anywhere in the USA. The online menu reflects what we sell in-store. Keep an eye out for our seasonal offerings. They are made in limited batches!</p>
